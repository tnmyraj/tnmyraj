Hi, I’m Tanmay 😄

I’m a Cloud, AI & Data Engineering graduate student with hands-on experience building scalable, cloud-native data and AI solutions.

I specialize in Python, SQL, AWS, and data engineering, with experience designing ETL/ELT pipelines, serverless architectures, and AI-powered applications that transform raw data into actionable insights.

AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate and Tableau Desktop Specialist certified, with a strong foundation in cloud design, data visualization, and analytics.

Former Software Engineer at Cognizant, where I supported and optimized AWS-based production data pipelines handling large-scale workloads.

Currently pursuing a Master’s in Information Technology & Management at UT Dallas and actively seeking Cloud, AI, and Data Engineering internship/full-time opportunities.
